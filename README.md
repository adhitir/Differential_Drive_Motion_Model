# Differential_Drive_Motion_Model
Differential drive robot with simulated Lidar data, ground truth and simulated encoder data in Simulink

This simulink model provide a simulated lidar reading for two obstacles in it's enviroment while the robot charts a trajectory. It also provides a noisy simulated encoder output, noisy GPS output, as well as ground truth. It is a perfect model to practice filtering techniques for localization.
